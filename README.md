![CLIP](/figures/satclip.png)

*Overview of the pretraining and deployment pipeline for SatCLIP.*

## Approach

SatCLIP trains location and image encoders via contrastive learning, by matching images to their corresponding locations. This is analogous to the CLIP approach, which matches images to their corresponding text. Through this process, the location encoder learns characteristics of a location, as represented by satellite imagery. For more details, check out our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17179).

## Overview

Usage of SatCLIP is simple:

```python
from model import *
from location_encoder import *

model = SatCLIP(
    embed_dim=512,
    image_resolution=224, in_channels=13, vision_layers=4, vision_width=768, vision_patch_size=32, # Image encoder
    le_type='sphericalharmonics', pe_type='siren', legendre_polys=10, frequency_num=16, max_radius=360, min_radius=1, harmonics_calculation='analytic'  # Location encoder
)

img_batch = torch.randn(32, 13, 224, 224) # Represents a batch of 32 images
loc_batch = torch.randn(32, 2) # Represents the corresponding 32 locations (lon/lat)

with torch.no_grad():
    logits_per_image, logits_per_coord = model(img_batch, loc_batch)
    probs = logits_per_image.softmax(dim=-1).detach().cpu().numpy()
```

## Training

You first need to download the *S2-100k* dataset. This can be done directly via [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/davanstrien/satclip), using the `huggingface_hub` library:
```python
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
snapshot_download("davanstrien/satclip", local_dir='.', repo_type='dataset')
```
Alternatively you can clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/davanstrien/satclip
```

Now, to train **SatCLIP** models, set the paths correctly, adapt training configs in `satclip/configs/default.yaml` and train SatCLIP by running:
```bash
cd satclip
python main.py
```

### Use of the S2-100K dataset

The S2-100K dataset is a dataset of 100,000 multi-spectral satellite images sampled from Sentinel-2 via the [Microsoft Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/). Copernicus Sentinel data is captured between Jan 1, 2021 and May 17, 2023. The dataset is sampled approximately uniformly over landmass and only includes images without cloud coverage. The dataset is available for research purposes only. If you use the dataset, please cite our paper. More information on the dataset can be found in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17179).

## Pretrained Models

![CLIP](/figures/globes.gif)

*Visualization of embeddings obtained by different location encoders for locations around the globe.*

We provide six pretrained SatCLIP models, trained with different vision encoders and spatial resolution hyperparameters $L$ (these indicate the number of Legendre polynomials used for spherical harmonics location encoding. Please refer to our paper for more details). The pretrained models can be downloaded directly via [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?other=arxiv:2311.17179):

Usage of pretrained models is simple. Simply specify the SatCLIP model you want to access, e.g. `satclip-vit16-l40`:
```python
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
from load import get_satclip
import torch

device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"

c = torch.randn(32, 2)  # Represents a batch of 32 locations (lon/lat)

model = get_satclip(
    hf_hub_download("microsoft/SatCLIP-ViT16-L40", "satclip-vit16-l40.ckpt"),
    device=device,
)  # Only loads location encoder by default
model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    emb = model(c.double().to(device)).detach().cpu()
```

## Examples

Examples on how to obtain and use pretrained SatCLIP embeddings can be found in the `notebooks` folder. We provide notebooks (optimized for use with Google Colab) for the following use cases.
